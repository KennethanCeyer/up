<p align="center">Experimental: Thread-friendly interpreter programming language</p>
<p align="center"><img src="./docs/logo.svg" width="140" alt="up" /></p>

## Features

- Optimized for lightweight threading.
- Strongly influenced by both the Go (Golang) and Python programming languages.
- While garbage collection (GC) exists, it minimizes lock overhead by leveraging the CAS Atomic Operator.
- It's a dynamically typed language; however, users can specify strong types for instances where high performance is a necessity.
- Features a straightforward and easily comprehensible grammatical structure.
- Developed as an experimental language, intended for long-term project exploration and refinement.

## Overview

The `up` language aspires to marry the ease of use seen in languages like Python with the concurrency advantages inherent to languages like Go. Its design philosophy centers on offering a platform where developers can utilize threads without confronting the usual associated intricacies. As a unique proposition in the programming language spectrum, `up` merits exploration by those keen on advancing the paradigms of contemporary programming.

## Getting Started

```bash
go run . {.up file path}
```

Example:

```bash
go run . examples/for_loop.up
```

This project is working in progress. There may be an error in the code's behavior.

## Specs

### Background

Up Language draws inspiration from both Go and Python, combining the performance-oriented aspects of Go with the user-friendly characteristics of Python. Here are some key differences that set Up apart:

- **Performance and Ease of Use:** Up strikes a balance by adopting Go's performance while maintaining a focus on ease of use, making it versatile for various programming tasks.

- **Interpreter Language:** Like Python, Up supports an interpreter-based approach, enabling developers to write and test code more efficiently.

- **Class Support:** Like Python, Up Language embraces class support, allowing for object-oriented programming.

- **Thread Friendliness:** Similar to Go, Up allows for lightweight threading, potentially leading to thread friendliness.

- **Lightweight Threads:** Up introduces lightweight threads and communication between them through streams, facilitating concurrency.

- **Dynamic Typing:** Up supports dynamic typing, providing flexibility in programming.

- **Strong Typing (Variable-level):** Similar to Go, Up allows for strong typing at the variable level, potentially leading to performance improvements.

- **Class Receiver Definitions:** Unlike Go and Python, Up enables class receiver definitions, enhancing object-oriented programming capabilities.

- **Anonymous Functions:** Up Language encourages the use of anonymous functions, allowing developers to define functions without a formal name. This is particularly useful for creating small, specialized functions on the fly.

- **Built-in Higher-Order Functions:** Up Language offers a rich set of built-in higher-order functions that operate on functions, making it easier to work with collections, apply transformations, and manage control flow in a functional style.
